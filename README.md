### Investigating the Impact of Social Media Trends on Consumptive Behavior

Social media trends often rise rapidly, influencing consumer decisions through promotional content and continuous exposure. This project explores how social media trends drive consumptive behavior among students in the Mathematics Department and identifies the key factors affecting their purchasing habits.

#### Objective  
To analyze the influence of factors such as product content uniqueness, information quality, product quality, brand perception, and pricing on student purchasing behavior influenced by social media trends.

#### Methodology  
1. **Survey Design**  
   - Conducted a Likert-scale survey, with sample size determined using an estimated proportion formula.  
2. **Data Analysis**  
   - Validity and reliability tests were performed to filter significant questionnaire items.  
   - Data visualized through pie and bar charts.  
   - Linearity tested and normality assessed using Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests.  
   - Spearman’s correlation analysis applied due to non-normal and non-linear data distributions.  
   - Correlation plot generated to visualize variable relationships.

#### Key Findings  
- **Brand Perception**: Most influential factor affecting consumer behavior (**p = 0.000**, **r = 0.275**).  
- **Information Quality**: Significant impact on consumer behavior (**p = 0.000**, **r = 0.247**).  
- **Unique Content**: Notable influence on consumer behavior (**p = 0.001**, **r = 0.229**).  
- **Product Quality**: Did not significantly influence consumer behavior (**p = 0.060**, **r = 0.135**).  
- **Pricing**: Effect was inconclusive due to data validity issues.  

Brand perception, information quality, and content uniqueness exhibited a positive correlation with consumer behavior, indicating that stronger brand recognition, high-quality information, and unique content drive increased consumption.

#### Notes  
- **p**: P-value from the Spearman’s correlation test.  
- **r**: Correlation coefficient from the Spearman’s correlation test.
